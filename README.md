PHINet -  Personal Health Management at the palm of your hand.


Your heartrate helps doctors recognize potential diseases; one method they use is to check your heartrate using the pulse in your palm.

Technology has advanced to the point where we can use sensors in our smartphones to check our pulse, keep track of our medical history, and to search for cures for ailments with the same smartphones. We aim to allow the user to monitor and provision using these sensors. We aim to make healthcare more affordable by allowing the user to use these sensors to keep track of their health, and if it begins to deteriorate, a notification allow the user to better themselves.


PHINet is our way to monitor our health, by making it available worldwide, to prvide healthcare monitoring, healthcare history, and healthcare sensors for no cost.
